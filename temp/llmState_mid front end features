ORIGINAL PROMPT/CONVERSATION


Things are working well enough for this todo list, it's large, so if needed breakit down in to phases etc, do a comprehensive analysis for each, and report back, there are some questions and ponderings. Read the spec docs and design intent beforehand, so you can understand the 'why'. /home/user/neurosensefx/specs/

Todo:

Displays: - Price: decimal points: OK for FX. XAU and BTC incorrect. Calc must be different for symbol types and magnitudes. - Market Profile: single sided, add an option to combine buy and sell side (and still be able to chose left/right). - look at increasing the left to right levels of the buckets. i.e. more orizontal resolution. Un sure if this is a data bucket thing or ticks not 'stacking'. - surface 'Profile Levels' in configpanel I'm guessing this will affect the levels? - Future: Tick data instead of 1min (assess load/resource implications) - ADR axis: Bring infront of market profile, show markers for 0 and projectedHigh/low. add same for todaysHigh and low. - ADR Proximity Pulse: check. Seems to be linked to a display element (projectedHigh/low?) If so, that's good, those elements are good todisplay, we will refine that later. - Original proximity pulse was to visually pulse a horizontal bar at the top/bottom proximity %. - add pulse controls to configPannel - Price float: not centered on ADR axis (it's off to the left) - add price float pulse controls to configPannel - Volatility Orb: Debug configPannel, can't interact

Config Panel: - add controls for all elements for user testing/debugging etc. More the better at this point if they're organised appropriately. - keep debugging info panel.

Of course. This is an excellent to-do list that provides a clear path forward. I will approach this methodically, breaking it down into phases as you suggested. I will begin with a comprehensive analysis of the entire list, informed by the design documents, before starting implementation on the first phase.

First, I will read the specification and design intent documents to ensure my analysis and implementation align with your vision.

ASSESSING SPECIFICATION DOCUMENTS...

I have reviewed the following documents from the /home/user/neurosensefx/specs/ directory:

Ground-Up Build Plan (Performant & Simple).txt
NeuroSense FX_design intent.txt
Project Setup and Context .txt
Prototype script for ref_NeuroSense FX_trimmed.html_arch
The core principles are clear: the interface must be low-cognitive-load, performant, lean, and simple to maintain. It should rely on pre-attentive visual cues (like shape, motion, color) over complex charts. This philosophy will guide all my decisions.

Now, here is the comprehensive analysis and proposed plan for each item on your to-do list.

Analysis: The current price display formatting is hardcoded for standard FX pairs. For symbols like Gold (XAU, typically 2 decimal places) or Bitcoin (BTC, 0-2 decimal places), this is incorrect. The digits property we get from the backend correctly tells us how many decimal places a symbol has (e.g., 5 for EURUSD, 2 for XAUUSD). We are not using it correctly in the price display logic.
Plan:
Modify the drawPriceDisplay function in src/lib/viz/priceDisplay.js.
The function will use the digits value from the state object to correctly format the price string using toFixed(digits).
I will then refactor the logic that splits the price into "big figures," "pips," and "pipettes" to be dynamic based on the number of digits, ensuring it works for any instrument type.
Analysis & Plan: This requires a few sub-tasks.
A. Combined Buy/Sell View: The code snippet from the prototype shows that buy, sell, and total volumes are already being calculated in the worker.
Plan: I will add a marketProfileViewMode option to the config ('separate' or 'combined'). In drawMarketProfile.js, if the mode is 'combined', it will draw a single bar based on level.total volume, which can still be placed on the left or right of the axis as you requested.
B. Horizontal Resolution ("Levels of the buckets"): Your pondering is correctâ€”this is a combination of two factors. The "stacking" is the vertical resolution, and the bar width is the horizontal.
Vertical Resolution: The priceBucketSize config setting directly controls this. A smaller bucket size will create more, thinner vertical price levels, making the profile look more detailed.
Horizontal Resolution: The width of the bars is determined by the volume. The snippet maxDeviation = Math.max(maxDeviation, data.buy, data.sell); shows how the maximum volume is found, which then sets the scale.
Plan: First, I will add priceBucketSize to the Config Panel, which will give you direct control over the vertical "stacking" resolution. This is the most direct way to address the "squashed" look.
C. Future - Tick Data: Using live ticks instead of 1-minute bars is feasible but has significant performance implications.
Assessment: It would increase network traffic, backend load, and front-end memory/CPU usage in the data worker. However, since the processing is in a worker thread, the UI would remain responsive. This is a classic trade-off between real-time accuracy and resource usage. For now, using 1-minute bars is a robust and performant compromise.
Analysis: The ADR axis is currently drawn behind the market profile, and it lacks key markers.
Plan:
Z-Index (Drawing Order): In src/components/viz/Container.svelte, I will change the drawing order to call drawDayRangeMeter after drawMarketProfile, bringing the axis to the front.
Markers: I will modify drawDayRangeMeter.js to read adrHigh, adrLow, todaysHigh, and todaysLow from the state. I will then draw distinct horizontal lines or markers at the corresponding Y-positions, with labels.
Analysis: The design intent calls for a visual pulse when the price nears the ADR boundaries. Your hunch is correct; this should be tied to the projectedHigh and projectedLow values. The original prototype used a horizontal bar, which is more visually prominent than a simple glow.
Plan:
I will implement logic in drawDayRangeMeter.js to check if the currentPrice is within a configurable percentage of adrHigh or adrLow.
When the condition is met, I will draw a horizontal bar at the top or bottom of the display.
I will add controls to the ConfigPanel for pulseThreshold (percentage), pulseColor, and pulseWidth.
Analysis: You've spotted that the float is not centered on the ADR axis. This is a simple positioning calculation error.
Plan:
In drawPriceFloat.js, I will correct the x coordinate calculation for the float's rectangle. The correct formula to center it is centralAxisXPosition - (config.priceFloatWidth / 2). I will also ensure the priceFloatXOffset is applied correctly relative to this centered position.
I will add placeholder controls for a "Price Float Pulse" to the ConfigPanel for future implementation.
Analysis: The controls in the ConfigPanel are not working. This is a UI bug, likely due to a missing or incorrect event handler (on:change={handleConfigChange}) on the input elements for the orb.
Plan: I will inspect ConfigPanel.svelte and attach the correct Svelte event handlers to the Volatility Orb's controls to ensure they correctly update the configuration.
Analysis: The panel is functional but incomplete. To facilitate testing and tuning, it needs controls for all major visual parameters.
Plan: As I work through each display item above, I will simultaneously add the corresponding controls to ConfigPanel.svelte. This includes:
priceBucketSize for Market Profile.
ADR Pulse controls.
Price Float Pulse controls.
Any other hardcoded values that should be user-configurable.
The Live Debug Info panel will be kept as it is a crucial diagnostic tool.
I will proceed in the following order, as each step builds upon the last. I will pause for your confirmation after each phase.

Phase 1: Controls & Core Logic:
Fix the Volatility Orb controls in ConfigPanel.
Fix the Price Float centering.
Add the priceBucketSize control to the ConfigPanel to address the market profile's vertical resolution.
Phase 2: Market Profile Enhancements:
Implement the combined Buy/Sell view for the Market Profile.
Phase 3: ADR Axis and Markers:
Bring the ADR axis to the front.
Add the High/Low markers for both ADR and Today's range.
Phase 4: Price Display & Pulse Effects:
Fix the decimal point formatting for the Price Display.
Implement the ADR Proximity Pulse with a horizontal bar and add its controls.
This phased approach will allow us to make steady, verifiable progress.

I will begin with Phase 1, Item 1: Fixing the Volatility Orb controls. I will now locate the bug in ConfigPanel.svelte and apply the fix.
