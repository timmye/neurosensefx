# LLM Implementation Strategy for NeuroSense FX UI Transformation

## Overview

This document outlines a strategic approach for implementing the new NeuroSense FX UI architecture using LLM development. The focus is on creating chunkable, manageable work units that maintain context while minimizing dependencies and integration challenges.

## Core Principles for LLM Development

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Build the system in small, testable increments
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each component has well-defined inputs/outputs and responsibilities
3. **Documentation-Driven**: Comprehensive documentation precedes and guides implementation
4. **Test-First Approach**: Each chunk includes tests to validate functionality
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality and add features incrementally

## Execution Approaches

### Approach 1: Component-First (Recommended)

#### Rationale
- Provides clear visual feedback at each step
- Limits scope to individual UI elements
- Allows for parallel development of independent components
- Maintains focus on user experience throughout development

#### Implementation Strategy

1. **Design System Foundation**
   - CSS custom properties and design tokens
   - Base component styles and utility classes
   - Typography and spacing systems
   - Color palette and semantic color mapping

2. **Atomic UI Components**
   - Buttons, inputs, toggles, sliders
   - Status indicators and badges
   - Panel headers and tab containers
   - Each component developed in isolation with comprehensive testing

3. **Composite UI Components**
   - Connection status panel
   - Symbol selector component
   - Settings panel with tabs
   - Toolbar and workspace controls

4. **Visualization Components**
   - Price float with animations
   - Market profile rendering
   - Volatility orb with dynamic responses
   - ADR axis with boundary detection

5. **Canvas Container System**
   - Draggable canvas containers
   - Canvas selection and focus management
   - Canvas resizing and positioning
   - Workspace grid and layout management

#### Chunking Strategy

Each component chunk includes:
- Component specification (props, events, styling)
- Implementation file (Svelte component)
- Test file (unit tests and visual regression tests)
- Documentation file (usage examples and API reference)
- Integration points (how it connects to other components)

### Approach 2: Function-First

#### Rationale
- Focuses on core business logic first
- Ensures data flows work correctly before UI implementation
- Allows for parallel development of backend and frontend
- Provides a solid foundation for UI development

#### Implementation Strategy

1. **Data Layer Functions**
   - Symbol subscription management
   - Price data processing and normalization
   - WebSocket connection management
   - Data caching and persistence

2. **State Management Functions**
   - Store creation and management
   - State transformation functions
   - Reactive state subscriptions
   - State persistence and restoration

3. **Visualization Logic Functions**
   - Price float positioning calculations
   - Market profile data transformation
   - Volatility metric calculations
   - ADR boundary detection logic

4. **Interaction Logic Functions**
   - Canvas dragging and positioning
   - Component selection and focus management
   - Settings persistence and application
   - Workspace management functions

5. **Integration Functions**
   - Component event handling
   - Cross-component communication
   - Data flow orchestration
   - Error handling and recovery

#### Chunking Strategy

Each function chunk includes:
- Function specification (inputs, outputs, behavior)
- Implementation file (JavaScript/TypeScript functions)
- Test file (unit tests with edge cases)
- Documentation file (function reference and examples)
- Integration points (how it connects to other functions and components)

### Approach 3: Hybrid Approach (Most Robust)

#### Rationale
- Combines the strengths of both component-first and function-first approaches
- Provides flexibility to choose the best approach for each chunk
- Allows for iterative refinement of the implementation strategy
- Balances UI feedback with solid foundations

#### Implementation Strategy

1. **Foundation Phase**
   - Design system implementation
   - Core data layer functions
   - Basic state management setup
   - Development environment configuration

2. **Parallel Development Tracks**
   - **UI Components Track**: Implement atomic and composite components
   - **Visualization Logic Track**: Implement visualization calculation functions
   - **Interaction Logic Track**: Implement user interaction handling
   - **Integration Track**: Connect components with logic and data

3. **Integration Phase**
   - Connect components to their respective logic functions
   - Implement data flows between components
   - Add error handling and edge case management
   - Optimize performance and user experience

4. **Refinement Phase**
   - Add advanced features and interactions
   - Implement workspace management capabilities
   - Add persistence and configuration options
   - Polish animations and transitions

#### Chunking Strategy

Each chunk follows a consistent structure:
1. **Specification Document**: Detailed requirements and design
2. **Implementation Files**: Code for the chunk (components, functions, styles)
3. **Test Files**: Comprehensive tests for the chunk
4. **Documentation Files**: Usage examples and API reference
5. **Integration Guide**: How to integrate with other chunks
