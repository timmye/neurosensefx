# Chunk Priority Analysis for Live System

## Current Status: 65% Complete

### ✅ What's Working (Foundation + Components)
- Design system and atomic components
- State management stores
- Individual panels (Connection, Service Status, Settings)
- Basic visualization components
- Testing infrastructure

### ❌ What's Blocking Live System (Canvas System)
- **NO WORKING CANVAS WORKSPACE** - This is the core user interface
- **NO INDICATOR SYSTEM INTEGRATION** - Visualizations aren't connected
- **NO LAYOUT MANAGEMENT** - Can't arrange trading displays
- **NO DRAG & DROP** - Can't interact with canvases

## Critical Path to MVP Live System

### Priority 1: Canvas System (Phase 4)
**Why Critical**: This is the actual trading interface users see and interact with

**Must Complete**:
1. **Chunk 4.1**: Canvas Container Component - Main display area
2. **Chunk 4.2**: Workspace Manager Component - Layout orchestration  
3. **Chunk 4.3**: Workspace Grid Component - Canvas positioning
4. **Chunk 4.4**: Drag & Drop System - User interactions

**Impact**: Without these, users cannot see or interact with trading data

### Priority 2: Integration (Phase 5)
**Why Critical**: Connects all our components into a working application

**Must Complete**:
1. **Chunk 5.1**: Component Data Integration - Connect visualizations to real data
2. **Chunk 5.3**: Error Handling & Recovery - Prevent crashes
3. **Chunk 5.4**: Performance Optimization - Ensure smooth operation

**Impact**: Without these, the system is unstable and slow

### Priority 3: Polish (Phase 6)
**Nice to Have**:
1. **Chunk 6.1**: Advanced Workspace Features
2. **Chunk 6.2**: Import/Export Functionality  
3. **Chunk 6.3**: Animation & Transitions

**Impact**: Professional polish but not required for basic functionality

## Implementation Strategy

### Focus on Working Trading Interface
Instead of completing ALL chunks, focus on minimal working system:

1. **Get Canvas System Working** - Users can see and interact with trading data
2. **Connect to Real Data** - Use existing WebSocket/price data
3. **Basic Error Handling** - System doesn't crash
4. **Performance Optimization** - Smooth real-time updates

### Skip Complex Features Initially
- Advanced workspace templates
- Complex import/export
- Fancy animations
- Comprehensive testing of every component

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Implement CanvasContainer.svelte (Chunk 4.1)
2. Implement WorkspaceManager.svelte (Chunk 4.2) 
3. Implement basic drag & drop (Chunk 4.4)
4. Connect to existing data layer (Chunk 5.1)
5. Basic error handling (Chunk 5.3)

**Expected Result**: Working trading interface where users can:
- See real-time price visualizations
- Arrange multiple trading canvases
- Interact with charts and indicators
- Have a stable, performant experience

This approach gets us to a **tested, live system** much faster than trying to complete every single chunk perfectly.
