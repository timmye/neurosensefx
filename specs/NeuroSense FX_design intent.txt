NeuroSense FX: A Human-Centric Visual Trading Interface
The "NeuroSense FX" display is a highly intuitive and low-cognitive-load Human-Machine Interface (HMI) meticulously crafted for professional traders. Its core purpose is to provide real-time, perceptual insights into Foreign Exchange (FX) prices and market activity, minimizing cognitive fatigue during extensive daily use (8-12 hours). It achieves this by applying principles from human factors, neuroscience, and military display design, emphasizing pre-attentive processing and abstract, non-numerical visual cues over traditional chart representations.

The display area is precisely defined at 220px wide and 120px high, serving as a compact, yet rich, visual workspace. It features a dark, minimalist background and leverages D3.js for smooth, dynamic vector graphics.

I. Foundational Principles & Design Philosophy
Human-Centric Design: Prioritizes reducing cognitive load and supporting deep perceptual learning for high-exposure trading environments.

Pre-attentive Processing: Leverages fundamental visual attributes (e.g., motion, curvature, density, line length, orientation, hue, intensity) for rapid, unconscious information uptake.

Abstract Visual Metaphors: Represents market "heartbeat," volatility, and historical context through non-numerical cues, deliberately avoiding traditional charts.

Adaptive Dynamic Cues: Visual elements dynamically respond to market conditions, ensuring the display is always relevant and informative.

Glanceability & Sustained Sensitivity: Designed for quick comprehension and to prevent fatigue over long trading sessions.

II. Core Visualization Components & Interactions
The display's elements are intricately linked, with the ADR (Average Daily Range) axis serving as the primary Y-axis reference for other visual components.

Day Range Meter (Primary Y-Axis Reference):

A central vertical axis that can be moved horizontally (left to right) within the display area.

Primary Reference: Its core intent is to provide the user with a visual reference of where the current price is within the Average Daily Range, indicated by the Price Float's level relative to the top/bottom boundaries and graduation marks (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75% ADR levels).

Displays ADR Boundary Lines and ADR Step Markers.

ADR Proximity Pulse: Boundary lines visually "pulse" (change color and glow blue) when the current price approaches the ADR extremes, providing a subtle, pre-attentive alert.

Configurable ADR Range, Pulse Threshold, and Pulse Scale.

Price Float:

A thin, soft purple horizontal line with a glow effect that precisely represents the current FX price.

Undergoes smooth transitions to reflect price changes.

Its width and horizontal offset are configurable.

Price Display (Numeric):

A distinct numeric representation of the current price, using a monospaced font.

Crucially, this display tracks the Price Float up and down, providing an additional visual reference to its vertical position relative to the ADR bounds.

Customizable font sizes for "big figures," "pips," and "pipettes" (the smallest digit), allowing emphasis on different parts of the price.

Adjustable font weight and horizontal offset.

Optional Price Bounding Box and Price Background.

Includes a toggle for Pipette Digit visibility.

Volatility Orb:

A circular visual element, centered in the background of the display.

Works in conjunction with a "flash" mechanism to essentially change the visual prominence of the display based on market volatility.

Configurable Base Width.

Color Modes: Offers "Directional," "Intensity Spectrum," and "Single Hue (Purple)" options to visualize volatility, allowing different encoding methods for market state.

Invert Brightness (Inward Growth): An option for the orb to grow inward, providing an alternative perceptual cue for volatility.

Can be toggled on/off.

Market Profile:

A visual representation of price distribution over time (or buy/sell pressure).

Aligns to the ADR axis (can be displayed on the left AND/OR right side of the axis).

Plots as the price moves up and down, providing the user with an intuitive understanding of the day's price history and areas of significant activity.

Buy activity is depicted with bluish tones, and sell activity with reddish tones, with smooth width transitions for bars.

Distribution Depth: Can display the entire profile or a percentage of recent activity.

Outline View: Displays a smoothed SVG outline of the market profile, offering an abstract "shape" of market activity.

Single-Sided Profile: Can optionally display only the left (buy) or right (sell) side of the profile.

Can be toggled on/off.

III. Event Highlighting & Simulation
Flash on Significant Tick: The entire display can visually "flash" (e.g., screen dimming, color shift) when a price change exceeds a set threshold, with adjustable intensity, acting as a critical alert.

Flash Volatility Orb: The Volatility Orb can specifically flash on significant ticks, with configurable thresholds and intensity, reinforcing volatility alerts.

Simulation Controls: Includes controls for simulating various market activity levels (Calm, Normal, Active, Volatile) for testing and demonstration.

IV. Systemic Integration & User Control
The visualization area is dynamically resizable, and a comprehensive control panel allows for extensive customization of all visual elements—including their size, position, color modes, and activation thresholds. This high degree of tunability ensures that professional traders can precisely tailor the "NeuroSense FX" display to their individual perceptual preferences and the nuances of the live market, fostering an unparalleled level of intuitive market understanding.
