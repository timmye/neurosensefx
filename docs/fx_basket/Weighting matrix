Analysis of Major Currency Basket Weightings
1. Introduction
Currency baskets are essential tools for understanding the overall value and influence of a currency in the global economy. By aggregating the exchange rates of a base currency against a weighted set of other currencies, these baskets provide a broader perspective than individual bilateral exchange rates. A currency weighting matrix further enhances this understanding by presenting a structured overview of the relative importance of different currencies within these baskets. This report aims to construct such a matrix, detailing the currency weighting for each of the major global currencies – the US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Swiss Franc (CHF), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), and Chinese Yuan (CNY) – against a selection of other significant currencies. The analysis utilizes provided research snippets to extract the most recent available weighting information for various currency indices and effective exchange rate measures, acknowledging that the composition and weighting methodologies can vary across different sources and reflect specific analytical or policy objectives.
2. Methodology of Currency Weighting
The construction of currency baskets relies on various methodologies to determine the weight assigned to each constituent currency. These methodologies reflect different economic perspectives and analytical goals. Trade-weighted indices, as indicated in numerous sources 1, are among the most common, where weights are primarily based on the volume of bilateral trade flows between the country issuing the base currency and its trading partners. The rationale behind this approach is that the importance of a currency is directly proportional to the extent of trade conducted with the issuing country. In some instances, the relative size of a trading partner's economy, often measured by its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), is also considered in the weighting scheme 1, as this can reflect a broader economic influence beyond just trade volumes.
A more sophisticated approach involves competition-based weighting, which takes into account not only the direct trade between countries but also the competitive pressures faced in both the domestic market from imports and in third-country markets from other exporters.6 This methodology provides a more nuanced understanding of currency influence by considering the competitive dynamics in international markets. Institutions like the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) employ double-weighting schemes 5, which further refine the weighting by considering both the direct bilateral trade and the indirect influence of a trading partner through competition in third markets.
It is important to note that currency weights are not static and are often updated periodically – annually, triennially, or at other intervals – by the compiling institutions.3 These updates are crucial as the patterns of international trade and economic relationships are constantly evolving. Factors such as the rise of new economic powers, shifts in consumer demand, and geopolitical events can significantly alter the importance of different trading partners over time. Regular adjustments to currency weights ensure that the indices remain accurate and relevant indicators of currency relationships in the contemporary global economy.

"(Likely Significant)" or "(Likely Low)" indicates expected relative weight based on methodology but not explicitly stated in snippets. For CAD and CHF, comprehensive weight breakdowns were not available in the provided snippets.
3.1 USD Basket
The US Dollar's value is often gauged by its performance against a basket of other currencies. The US Dollar Index (DXY) 50 provides a measure against six major currencies: the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona, and Swiss Franc. The Euro holds the most significant weight at 57.6%, reflecting the substantial trade and financial relationship between the US and the Eurozone. The Japanese Yen (13.6%) and British Pound (11.9%) also have substantial weights, followed by the Canadian Dollar (9.1%), Swedish Krona (4.2%), and Swiss Franc (3.6%). Notably, this index does not include the Australian Dollar, New Zealand Dollar, or Chinese Yuan in its composition, and the listed weights sum to 99.0%.
The Federal Reserve also calculates a Broad Trade-Weighted U.S. Dollar Index 51, which encompasses a more extensive set of currencies reflecting a broader range of US trading partners. As of 2025, the weights for the listed major currencies in this index are: Euro (16.531%), Japanese Yen (5.270%), British Pound (3.122%), Australian Dollar (1.436%), Canadian Dollar (13.800%), Swiss Franc (1.624%), New Zealand Dollar (0.956%), and Chinese Yuan (11.212%). This index includes many more currencies, and the sum of the weights for just these major currencies is approximately 53.951%. The difference in composition and weighting between the DXY and the Fed's Broad Index highlights different perspectives on measuring the dollar's international value. The DXY focuses on a historically significant set of developed market currencies, while the Fed's Broad Index aims for a more comprehensive representation of current US trade patterns by including a wider array of currencies, including those from emerging economies with growing trade volumes with the US.
3.2 EUR Basket
The Euro's effective exchange rate is tracked by the European Central Bank (ECB) through the EER-41 index 52, which measures the euro's value against the currencies of 41 of the Eurozone's most important trading partners. Based on the 2019-2021 reference period, the weights of the major currencies within this basket are: US Dollar (16.0%), Japanese Yen (3.7%), British Pound (10.4%), Australian Dollar (0.7%), Canadian Dollar (1.4%), Swiss Franc (5.9%), New Zealand Dollar (0.1%), and Chinese Yuan (15.8%). The inclusion of 41 trading partners underscores the Eurozone's extensive and diversified international trade relationships. The significant weighting of the US Dollar and the Chinese Renminbi reflects their importance as major global economies and key trading partners for the Eurozone. The remaining weight in the index is distributed among the other 33 trading partners, further illustrating the breadth of the Eurozone's trade network.
3.3 JPY Basket
Information on the specific weights of currencies within the Japanese Yen basket is not directly provided in the research snippets. However, it is noted that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) utilizes the broad-based effective exchange rates released by the BIS.53 The BIS methodology for constructing effective exchange rates emphasizes manufacturing trade flows and considers competition in both bilateral trade and third-country markets.5 Given this methodology, it can be inferred that the Japanese Yen basket likely includes significant weights for major manufacturing economies that are key trading partners for Japan or compete with Japanese manufacturers globally. These would likely include the United States, China, and countries within the Eurozone, although the exact weights are not specified in the provided materials.
3.4 GBP Basket
The Bank of England calculates the Sterling Exchange Rate Index (ERI) to measure the overall change in the trade-weighted exchange value of sterling.26 The weights in the ERI are updated annually to reflect changing trade patterns. Based on the 2023 weights, which are derived from 2022 trade data, the weights for the major currencies show the Euro area with the most significant weight at 41.2%, followed by the United States at 21.8%. The Japanese Yen accounts for 2.7%, and the Chinese Yuan for 10.4%. While individual weights for the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, and New Zealand Dollar are not explicitly listed as separate components in the provided table, they are included within the "Rest of the World" total, which constitutes 58.8% of the index. The substantial weighting of the Euro area and the US Dollar reflects the UK's strong trade and financial ties with these regions. The annual reweighting process allows the index to adapt to shifts in the UK's global trade relationships, as seen with the recent adjustment in the weight of the Chinese Yuan.
3.5 AUD Basket
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) publishes a Trade Weighted Index (TWI) for the Australian Dollar.15 The weights in this index are updated annually and are based on the composition of Australia's merchandise goods and services trade. As of January 10, 2025, the currency with the largest weight in the TWI is the Chinese Renminbi at 29.4813%. The US Dollar holds the second-largest weight at 11.2760%, followed by the Japanese Yen at 10.1037% and the Euro at 8.5669%. Other major currencies included in the TWI are the British Pound Sterling (3.1221%), Canadian Dollar (0.9561%), Swiss Franc (0.8195%), and New Zealand Dollar (3.4054%). The sum of these listed weights is approximately 67.7300%. The TWI includes a total of 18 currencies, with the remaining weight distributed among other trading partners. The heavy weighting of the Chinese Yuan underscores the significant trade relationship between Australia and China, driven largely by Australia's commodity exports. The inclusion of the Swiss Franc from 2025 indicates the evolving nature of Australia's trade patterns.
3.6 CAD Basket
The Bank of Canada's Canadian Effective Exchange Rate (CEER) index is a weighted average of bilateral exchange rates for the Canadian Dollar against the currencies of Canada's major trading partners.27 The CEER index includes a "major currencies index" comprising the US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Swiss Franc, Australian Dollar, and Swedish Krona. The Chinese Renminbi is included in the "other important trading partners (OITP) index." The New Zealand Dollar is not mentioned as a component currency in the CEER index in the provided snippets. The Bank of Canada employs a competition-based weighting methodology for the CEER index, which takes into account both Canada's bilateral trade with another country and the competition Canada faces from that country on a product-by-product basis in third markets.6 The weights are updated annually to reflect Canada's evolving trade patterns. While the specific weights for each currency are not detailed in the snippets, the Bank of Canada indicates that historical data for the total weights of each included currency are available for download in XML, JSON, or CSV formats.27
3.7 CHF Basket
Similar to the Japanese Yen, specific weights for the currencies within the Swiss Franc basket, as measured by the BIS Broad Effective Exchange Rate, are not provided in the research snippets. However, given that Switzerland has a substantial manufacturing sector and close economic ties with the Eurozone and the United States, it is highly probable that these regions' currencies would hold significant weights in its effective exchange rate basket. The BIS methodology, which emphasizes manufacturing trade flows and global competition 5, would likely be the basis for determining these weights. Therefore, while the exact percentages are not available, major trading partners of Switzerland, particularly in Europe and North America, would be expected to have the most influence on the Swiss Franc's effective exchange rate.
3.8 NZD Basket
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) calculates a Trade Weighted Index (TWI) for the New Zealand Dollar.19 As of December 5, 2024, the weights for the major currencies in this index are: Chinese Yuan (0.2174 or 21.74%), Australian Dollar (0.1840 or 18.40%), US Dollar (0.1562 or 15.62%), Euro (0.0917 or 9.17%), Singapore Dollar (0.0570 or 5.70%), Japanese Yen (0.0551 or 5.51%), British Pound (0.0388 or 3.88%), and Canadian Dollar (0.0141 or 1.41%). The Swiss Franc is not listed as one of the 17 currencies included in the TWI basket in the provided snippets. The TWI utilizes a fully bilateral trade-weighted methodology, taking into account trade in both goods and services, with weights updated annually. The significant weights of the Chinese Yuan and Australian Dollar reflect the strong trade and economic linkages within the Asia-Pacific region for New Zealand.
3.9 CNY Basket
The China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) publishes the RMB Index, which measures the value of the Chinese Yuan against a basket of currencies.54 As of January 1, 2025, the weights for the specified major currencies in the CFETS RMB Index are: US Dollar (18.903%), Euro (17.902%), Japanese Yen (8.584%), British Pound (2.705%), Australian Dollar (5.947%), Canadian Dollar (2.402%), Swiss Franc (1.551%), and New Zealand Dollar (0.570%). The sum of these listed weights is approximately 58.564%. The CFETS RMB Index includes a total of 25 currencies, with the remaining weight distributed among other significant trading partners. The substantial weighting of the US Dollar and Euro underscores their continued importance in China's international trade, while the inclusion of a relatively broad basket reflects China's diversified global trade relationships.
4. Key Takeaways and Implications
The currency weighting matrix reveals several important aspects of global currency relationships. Major currencies like the US Dollar and the Euro consistently appear with significant weights across various baskets, highlighting their central role in international trade and finance.56 This reflects the extensive use of these currencies in invoicing, payments, and as reserve assets. The comparison of weights for the same currency across different base currency baskets indicates the varying degrees of economic interdependence between countries. For instance, the weight of the Euro in the USD basket is substantial, and similarly, the USD holds a significant weight in the EUR basket, demonstrating the deep economic relationship between these two major currency areas.
The increasing prominence of the Chinese Renminbi in several baskets, particularly its own and those of Australia and New Zealand 57, signals China's growing economic influence on the global stage. Its rising weight reflects the increasing volume of trade and financial transactions involving China. Conversely, the relatively lower weights of currencies like the Swiss Franc and New Zealand Dollar in many baskets, despite their economic significance, suggest that their economies might have more specialized or regionally focused trade relationships compared to the larger economic blocs.
The differences observed between narrow and broad indices, such as in the case of the British Pound, illustrate the trade-off between focusing on core trading partners and capturing a more comprehensive view of international competitiveness.4 Narrow indices provide insights into the most critical currency relationships, while broad indices offer a wider perspective on how a currency performs against a larger set of trading partners, potentially capturing indirect competitive effects. Finally, the periodic updating of these currency weights by central banks and international organizations underscores the dynamic nature of global trade and the necessity to adapt these measures to reflect current economic realities.49
5. Conclusion
Understanding currency weighting matrices is crucial for analyzing exchange rate dynamics and their implications for international trade and economic policy. This report has provided a snapshot of the currency weights for nine major global currencies based on the latest available information from various indices. The analysis reveals the dominant roles of the US Dollar and Euro in the global financial system, the increasing influence of the Chinese Renminbi, and the regional significance of currencies like the Australian and New Zealand Dollars. The composition and weighting of these currency baskets are determined by a variety of methodologies, reflecting different analytical and policy objectives. As global trade patterns continue to evolve, the weights within these baskets will also change, highlighting the need for ongoing monitoring and analysis of these key economic indicators. When interpreting exchange rate movements and their impact, it is essential to consider the specific methodology and composition of the underlying currency basket to draw accurate and meaningful conclusions.
