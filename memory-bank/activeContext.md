# NeuroSense FX - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Phase 1 Canvas-Centric Interface Analysis - COMPLETED ✅**
Successfully completed comprehensive assessment of Phase 1 frontend upgrade documentation. Created implementation_plan.md as primary development reference with complete technical specifications for transforming from monolithic control panel to canvas-centric interface. Achieved 100% coverage of 85+ visualization parameters mapped to context menus. Established optimal documentation structure for LLM development with GLM 4.6 (15k-70k token range based on task complexity). **Implementation plan is ready for Phase 1 execution with incremental migration approach**.

**Serena MCP Server Installation & Testing - COMPLETED ✅**
Successfully installed, configured, and tested the Serena MCP server for semantic code analysis and editing capabilities. The server provides powerful symbol navigation, semantic editing, memory management, and project analysis tools specifically configured for the NeuroSense FX codebase. UVX-based installation with project-specific configuration at `.serena/project.yml` and IDE-assistant context for VSCode integration. **MCP server is now fully functional and connected via Cline**.

**DevContainer Automatic Serena Initialization - COMPLETED ✅**
Fixed DevContainer configuration to automatically set up Serena MCP server during container creation. Updated Dockerfile to properly install UV for the node user and integrated Serena setup into devcontainer.json postCreateCommand. Serena now initializes automatically during dev container rebuilds.

**BrowserTools MCP Server Installation - COMPLETED ✅**
Successfully installed and configured the BrowserTools MCP server for comprehensive browser analysis during intensive frontend rewrites. The server is now available as "github.com/AgentDeskAI/browser-tools-mcp" and provides powerful browser debugging capabilities including screenshots, network monitoring, console logs, and accessibility audits. Integrated into the main run.sh startup sequence for foolproof always-available operation.

**Context7 MCP Server Installation - COMPLETED ✅**
Successfully installed and configured the Context7 MCP server for up-to-date code documentation. The server is now available as "github.com/upstash/context7-mcp" and provides access to current library documentation and code examples. All Memory Bank documentation has been properly maintained with correct two-server architecture terminology.

**Memory Bank Architecture Clarification Phase - COMPLETED ✅**
Successfully corrected all Memory Bank documentation to reflect the proper two-server architecture pattern. All references to "dev server" have been updated to "frontend server" and the distinction between frontend and backend servers is now clearly documented throughout the Memory Bank system.

## Architecture Clarification Summary

### Correct Server Terminology (Now Fixed)
- **Frontend Server**: Vite development server (port 5173) - serves Svelte application
- **Backend Server**: Node.js WebSocket server (port 8080) - handles data processing
- **Two Processes**: Separate frontend and backend processes
- **No "Dev Server"**: Eliminated incorrect terminology, now using "Frontend Server"

### Files Updated This Session
- ✅ `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Two-server architecture properly documented
- ✅ `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` - Frontend/backend server patterns documented
- ✅ `memory-bank/progress.md` - Server terminology corrected throughout
- ✅ `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated with correct architecture understanding

### Total Documentation Updates
- ✅ **4 Core Files Updated**: techContext.md, systemPatterns.md, progress.md, activeContext.md
- ✅ **43,826+ bytes**: Comprehensive project context with correct architecture
- ✅ **Consistent Terminology**: All files now use proper two-server architecture language

The NeuroSense FX project now has a robust, accurately documented Memory Bank system that reflects the correct two-server architecture and will ensure consistent, context-aware development across all future sessions.
