# NeuroSense FX - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Professional Trading Problem
Professional FX traders face a critical cognitive challenge during extended trading sessions (8-12 hours daily). Traditional trading interfaces create significant cognitive fatigue through:

- **Information Overload**: Complex charts with excessive numerical data
- **Constant Context Switching**: Multiple windows and interfaces
- **Delayed Pattern Recognition**: Numerical processing requiring conscious effort
- **Visual Fatigue**: Bright, cluttered interfaces causing eye strain
- **Reaction Time Degradation**: Cognitive load slowing decision-making

### The NeuroSense Solution
NeuroSense FX addresses these problems through **perceptual processing** rather than **numerical processing**, leveraging principles from human factors engineering, neuroscience, and military display design.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Human-Centric Design Principles

#### **Pre-attentive Processing**
The human visual system can process certain visual attributes (motion, color, size, orientation) without conscious effort. NeuroSense FX leverages this by:

- **Motion Cues**: Smooth transitions indicating price movement
- **Color Encoding**: Volatility and trend information through color
- **Density Visualization**: Market activity through visual density
- **Spatial Positioning**: Price position within range context

#### **Glanceability & Sustained Sensitivity**
Designed for quick comprehension without fatigue:
- **Compact Displays**: 220×120px workspace for focused information
- **Dark Minimalist Background**: Reduces eye strain during long sessions
- **Abstract Visual Metaphors**: Market "heartbeat" and volatility visualization
- **Adaptive Dynamic Cues**: Visual elements responding to market conditions

#### **Cognitive Load Reduction**
Minimizing mental effort required for market understanding:
- **Non-numerical Visual Cues**: Replacing complex chart analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Intuitive market state visualization
- **Contextual Information**: Price position within daily range
- **Subtle Alerts**: Pre-attentive warnings for significant events

### Military Display Design Influence
Borrowing from combat aircraft displays designed for high-stress environments:

- **High Contrast**: Clear visibility in various lighting conditions
- **Minimal Clutter**: Only essential information displayed
- **Information Density**: Maximum data in minimal space
- **Rapid Comprehension**: Split-second understanding requirements

## Target User Persona
