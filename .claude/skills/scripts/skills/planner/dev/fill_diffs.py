"""
Dev-Fill-Diffs - Step-based workflow for developer sub-agent.

Converts Code Intent sections to Code Changes (unified diffs) BEFORE TW review:
- Read target files from codebase
- Convert Code Intent prose to unified diffs
- Add context lines for reliable anchoring
- Edit plan file in-place

Sub-agents invoke this script immediately upon receiving their prompt.
The script provides step-by-step guidance; the agent follows exactly.
