Incoherence Detector - Step-based incoherence detection workflow

Usage:
    # Detection phase
    python3 incoherence.py --step-number 1 --total-steps 22 --thoughts "Analyzing project X"

    # Reconciliation phase (after user fills in resolutions)
    python3 incoherence.py --step-number 14 --total-steps 22 --thoughts "Reconciling..."

DETECTION PHASE (Steps 1-13):
    Steps 1-3 (Parent): Survey, dimension selection, exploration dispatch
    Steps 4-7 (Sub-Agent): Broad sweep, coverage check, gap-fill, format findings
    Step 8 (Parent): Synthesis & candidate selection
    Step 9 (Parent): Deep-dive dispatch
    Steps 10-11 (Sub-Agent): Deep-dive exploration and formatting
    Steps 12-13 (Parent): Verdict analysis, report generation

RECONCILIATION PHASE (Steps 14-22, after user edits report):
    Step 14 (Parent): Parse report, extract resolutions, detect already-resolved
    Step 15 (Parent): Analyze targets and select agent types
    Step 16 (Parent): Plan dispatch waves, detect file conflicts
    Step 17 (Parent): Dispatch current wave of agents
    Steps 18-19 (Sub-Agent): Apply resolution, format result
    Step 20 (Parent): Collect wave results, check for next wave
    Step 21 (Parent): Update original report with resolved status
    Step 22 (Parent): Output brief reconciliation summary

Reconciliation is idempotent - can be run multiple times on the same report.
Issues are skipped if: (a) no resolution provided, or (b) already resolved.

PREREQUISITE: User must specify report filename before step 1.

ABSTRACT DIMENSION CATALOG
==========================

Choose dimensions from this catalog based on Step 1 info sources.

CATEGORY A: SPECIFICATION VS BEHAVIOR
  - README/docs claim X, but code does Y
  - API documentation vs actual API behavior
  - Examples in docs that don't actually work
  Source pairs: Documentation <-> Code implementation

CATEGORY B: INTERFACE CONTRACT INTEGRITY
  - Type definitions vs actual runtime values
  - Schema definitions vs validation behavior
  - Function signatures vs docstrings
  Source pairs: Type/Schema definitions <-> Runtime behavior

CATEGORY C: CROSS-REFERENCE CONSISTENCY
  - Same concept described differently in different docs
  - Numeric constants/limits stated inconsistently
  - Intra-document contradictions
  Source pairs: Document <-> Document

CATEGORY D: TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY (Staleness)
  - Outdated comments referencing removed code
  - TODO/FIXME comments for completed work
  - References to renamed/moved files
  Source pairs: Historical references <-> Current state

CATEGORY E: ERROR HANDLING CONSISTENCY
  - Documented error codes vs actual error responses
  - Exception handling docs vs throw/catch behavior
  Source pairs: Error documentation <-> Error implementation

CATEGORY F: CONFIGURATION & ENVIRONMENT
  - Documented env vars vs actual env var usage
  - Default values in docs vs defaults in code
  Source pairs: Config documentation <-> Config handling code

CATEGORY G: AMBIGUITY & UNDERSPECIFICATION
  - Vague statements that could be interpreted multiple ways
  - Missing thresholds, limits, or parameters
  - Implicit assumptions not stated explicitly
  Detection method: Ask "could two people read this differently?"

CATEGORY H: POLICY & CONVENTION COMPLIANCE
  - Architectural decisions (ADRs) violated by implementation
  - Style guide rules not followed in code
  - "We don't do X" statements violated in codebase
  Source pairs: Policy documents <-> Implementation patterns

CATEGORY I: COMPLETENESS & DOCUMENTATION GAPS
  - Public API endpoints with no documentation
  - Functions/classes with no docstrings
  - Magic values/constants without explanation
  Detection method: Find code constructs, check if docs exist

CATEGORY J: COMPOSITIONAL CONSISTENCY
  - Claims individually valid but jointly impossible
  - Numeric constraints that contradict when combined
  - Configuration values that create impossible states
  - Timing/resource constraints that cannot all be satisfied
  Detection method: Gather related claims, compute implications, check for contradiction
  Example: timeout=30s, retries=10, max_duration=60s → 30×10=300≠60

CATEGORY K: IMPLICIT CONTRACT INTEGRITY
  - Names/identifiers promise behavior the code doesn't deliver
  - Function named validateX() that doesn't actually validate
  - Error messages that misrepresent the actual error
  - Module/package names that don't match contents
  - Log messages that lie about what happened
  Detection method: Parse names semantically, infer promise, compare to behavior
  Note: LLMs are particularly susceptible to being misled by names

SELECTION RULES:
- Select ALL categories relevant to Step 1 info sources
- Typical selection is 5-8 dimensions
- G, H, I, K are especially relevant for LLM-assisted coding
- J requires cross-referencing multiple claims (more expensive)
